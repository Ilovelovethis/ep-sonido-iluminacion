# EP Sonido Iluminación

This work includes many interesting visual features, or effects, given the nature of the client's business related to entertainment; a lot of fun has been had by such creative liberties.

There are 9 different pages in this multi-page application which include many things:

- Observers for scroll-based element reveals and re-ordering of layout at header and footer

- Reasonably invested button hover animations

- 3D interactive transformation for "Service cards"

- Mouse-following conic gradients

- Carousels with about 80 images and 10 videos

- Google Maps and Calendar embeds

- Contact form with extra details option

- I have also set up a sort of _Easter egg_ for the client who loves guitar: An underlined title that is grabbed by the mouse pointer and once "released" or "plucked" two different harp sounds play (which are a major third interval).

I have used (mostly) Nvim, and Vite, along with some Bash scripts to process assets.
Once I get those scripts up to snuff with help flags / arguments and all, I might push them, although there are plugins that would accomplish something similar.

_Better readme coming soon-ish... (?)_
